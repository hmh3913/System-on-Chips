2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_100mhz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_100mhz_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell iCPU/alu_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) iDec/cs_gpio_reg/CLR, iDec/cs_mem_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
