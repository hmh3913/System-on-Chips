REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net iCPU/branch_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin iCPU/branch_reg_i_2/O, cell iCPU/branch_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net iCPU/regfile_inst/x31_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin iCPU/regfile_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_1/O, cell iCPU/regfile_inst/cs_mem_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
